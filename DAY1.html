    <h2>HOW I REACHED?</h2>
    <p>My trip to Kedarnath was an unforgettable adventure that combined spirituality, nature, and physical challenge. I began the journey at Gaurikund, where the trek to the Kedarnath Temple started. The trek, spanning around 16 kilometers, was tough but incredibly rewarding, with scenic views of the surrounding Himalayas, forests, and rugged terrain.</p>

    <h2>AMAZING INSIDE THE TEMPLE!</h2>
    <p>The closer I got to the temple, the more I was in awe of the majestic surroundings. The Kedarnath Temple, nestled amidst towering snow-capped peaks, was even more beautiful in person than I imagined. The energy there was so peaceful and spiritual, with chants filling the air, and I felt a deep sense of reverence and connection.</p>
